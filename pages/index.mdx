## What is Byte Labs?

Byte Labs is both an [Open Source Organisation](https://github.com/Byte-Labs-Studio) and a [Fivem Store](https://byte-labs.tebex.io/). Which both provides high quality resources for both server owners and developers.

Byte Labs consist of a Core Team and a Community Team. The Core Team is responsible for the development of Byte Labs Flagship releases, while the Community Team
consist of developers who are willing to contribute to the organisation both through releasing or heavily contributing to Open Source and/or releasing their own paid resources through the organisation.

Either way, there is a level of standard that is met before anything is released under Byte Labs whether it is Open Source or Paid.
