The player must press the key when the the segment is inside the target zone.
    
```lua
    local success = exports.bl_ui:CircleSum(iterations, config)
```

- iterations: `number` is the amount of iterations the player has to complete.
    - 1 is the default iteration.
- config: `LengthConfig`

#### Example
```lua
local success = exports.bl_ui:CircleSum(3, {
    length = 4,
    duration = 5000,
})
```
