    local success = exports.bl_ui:MineSweeper(iterations, config)
```

- iterations: `number` is the amount of iterations the player has to complete.
    - 1 is the default iteration.

#### Example
```lua
local success = exports.bl_ui:MineSweeper(3, {
    grid = 4, -- grid 4x4
    duration = 10000, -- 10sec to fail
    target = 4, --target you need to remember
    previewDuration = 2000 --preview duration (time for red mines preview to hide)
})
```
