# Minigames

If you are planning on having minigames all throughout your resource, you should consider the following.

```lua
    local bl_ui = exports.bl_ui
```

So that you can easily access the minigames like following.


## Circle Progress

The player must press the key when the the segment is inside the target zone.
    
```lua
    local success = bl_ui:CircleProgress(iterations, difficulty)
```

- iterations?: `number` is the amount of iterations the player has to complete.
    - 1 is the default iteration.
- difficulty?: `number` (`1-100`) is the difficulty of the minigame, this will affect the speed of the circle.
    - 50 is the default difficulty.
- Possible Keys:
    - `1` `2` `3` `4`

```

## Key Circle

The player must press both of the keys shown as fast as possible before the time for that stage runs out.
    
```lua
    local success = bl_ui:KeyCircle(iterations, difficulty, numberOfKeys)
```

- iterations?: `number` is the amount of iterations the player has to complete.
    - 1 is the default iteration.
- difficulty?: `number` (`1-100`) is the difficulty of the minigame, this will affect the speed of the circle.
