### Setting Up Debug listeners
`web > utils > debug > receivers.ts` are the events that will emulate a client `RegisterNUICallback` and can optionally send back data after processing it.

### Setting Up Debug senders
`web > utils > debug > senders.ts` is where you can add your debug menu items that will show up in the debug menu when in the browser.
