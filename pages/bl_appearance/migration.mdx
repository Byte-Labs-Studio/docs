title: Migration
---

To migrate old skins, start by launching the Illenium appearance script and then connect to the server solo. Once connected, use the command /migrate `(make sure you have old appearance configured in the settings)`. After the migration is complete, you should see a print in console telling you number of characters migrated, then you can remove the old appearance script and switch to using only bl_appearance.
