<Steps>
#### First, to migrate old skins, start by launching the Illenium appearance script and then connect to the server solo. Once connected, use the command /migrate (make sure you have Illenium configured in the settings). After the migration is complete, you can remove the Illenium appearance script and switch to using only bl_appearance.

#### Now let edit the core so it will be compatible

### Modify `previewPed` Function in `client/character.lua` for `qbx-core` with

```lua
local function previewPed(citizenId)
    if not citizenId then
        local model = randomPedModels[math.random(1, #randomPedModels)]
        lib.requestModel(model, config.loadingModelsTimeout)
        SetPlayerModel(cache.playerId, model)
        return
    end

    exports.bl_appearance:SetPlayerPedAppearance(citizenId)
end
```

#### we're done now :)
