# Template Guide

Below is a list of functions that are available to use in your template.


## Configure

In `app.svelte` there is an object that you can configure.

```js
    CONFIG.set({
        fallbackResourceName: 'debug',
        allowEscapeKey: true,
    });
```

- fallbackResourceName: `string` The resource name to use if the resource name is not found while using localhost in the game.
- allowEscapeKey: `boolean` Allow the escape key to close the UI.


## Client

### SendNUIEvent

This is basically a shorthand for `SendNUIMessage` but it will automatically structure the data for you suitable for the UI.

```lua
SendNUIEvent(event, data)
```
- event: `string` The event name to send to the NUI
- data: `any` The data to send to the NUI

## UI

### SendEvent

Send an event to the Client

```js
SendEvent(event, data);
```

- event: `string` The event name to send to the client
- data: `any` The data to send to the client

### TempReceiveEvent

A disposable listener for an event from the Client.

YOU MUST DISPOSE. IF NOT THE LISTENER WILL KEEP LISTENING AND WILL CAUSE MEMORY LEAKS.

```js
// Listen for the event
const dispose = TempReceiveEvent(event, callback);

// Dispose the listener
dispose();
```
- event: `string` The event name to listen for
- callback: `function` The callback to run when the event is received

Return:
- dispose: `function` The function to call to dispose the listener


### Note
There are other functions available but as a developer using the template properly, you dont really need to use them.

These functions include:
- `ReceiveEvent`
- `DebugEventSend`
- `DebugEventReceive`
- `DebugEventCallback`
